# Development Applications Hub

## Overview
This repository serves as a development workspace containing multiple application bases for local testing and experimentation. Each application resides in its own directory and will eventually be migrated to separate repositories once they reach a more mature state.

## Repository Structure
```
/development-hub
├── landscape/          # Landscape application base
├── launcher/           # Launcher application base
├── opener/            # Opener application base
└── README.md
```

## Applications

### Landscape
A development sandbox for testing landscape-oriented features and functionalities.
- **Location**: `/landscape`
- **Status**: In development
- **Purpose**: Local testing and experimentation

### Launcher
Application launcher testing environment.
- **Location**: `/launcher`
- **Status**: In development
- **Purpose**: Local testing and experimentation

### Opener
File/Application opener development workspace.
- **Location**: `/opener`
- **Status**: In development
- **Purpose**: Local testing and experimentation

## Development Purpose
This repository is intended for:
- Local development and testing
- Experimenting with different approaches and technologies
- Prototyping features before implementing them in production
- Testing integration possibilities between applications

## Future Plans
- Each application will eventually be moved to its own dedicated repository
- Further development and refinement of core functionalities
- Implementation of proper CI/CD pipelines after migration
- Addition of comprehensive documentation for each application

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Git installed on your machine
- Appropriate development environment set up for each application
- Required dependencies installed (see individual application directories for specific requirements)

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired application directory:
   ```bash
   cd development-hub/<application-name>
   ```
3. Follow the specific setup instructions in each application's directory

## Contributing
As this is a personal development workspace, contributions are not currently accepted. Each application will have its own contribution guidelines once moved to dedicated repositories.

## Notes
- This repository is for development purposes only
- Code may be experimental or incomplete
- Documentation within each application directory may be minimal
- No production deployments should be made directly from this repository
